## 描述
>You are working for Macrohard company in data structures department. After failing your previous task about key insertion you were asked to write a new data structure that would be able to return quickly k-th order statistics in the array segment.
>That is, given an array $a[1...n]$ of different integer numbers, your program must answer a series of questions $Q(i, j, k)$ in the form: "What would be the k-th number in $a[i...j]$ segment, if this segment was sorted?"
>For example, consider the array $a = (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4)$. Let the question be $Q(2, 5, 3)$. The segment a[2...5] is $(5, 2, 6, 3)$. If we sort this segment, we get $(2, 3, 5, 6)$, the third number is 5, and therefore the answer to the question is 5.
## 输入
>The first line of the input file contains $n$ --- the size of the array, and $m$ --- the number of questions to answer $(1 <= n <= 100 000, 1 <= m <= 5 000)$.
>The second line contains n different integer numbers not exceeding 109 by their absolute values --- the array for which the answers should be given.
>The following m lines contain question descriptions, each description consists of three numbers: $i, j,$ and $k (1 <= i <= j <= n, 1 <= k <= j - i + 1)$and represents the question $Q(i, j, k)$.
## 输出
>For each question output the answer to it --- the k-th number in sorted $a[i...j]$ segment.
## 样例输入
>7 3
>1 5 2 6 3 7 4
>2 5 3
>4 4 1
>1 7 3
## 样例输出
>5
>6
>3
## 提示
>This problem has huge input,so please use c-style input(scanf,printf),or you may got time limit exceed.
